# MOS 6502

The MOS 6502 was a very popular 8-bit CPU used by a number of 8-bit game consoles and computer systems. Some common machines that used the 6502:

- NES
- Atari 2600 (VCS)
- Atari 5200
- Atari 7800
- Atari 8-bit family (400, 800, 1200, 800XL, 1200XL, etc)
- Commodore 64
- Commodore 128
- Commodore VIC-20
- Apple II

## Miscellaneous

- `sizeof(*u8) = sizeof(u16)`
- `sizeof(far *u8) = sizeof(u24)`
- `carry` is the inverse of the borrow flag in subtraction/comparison (`true` when no borrow)

## Registers

- `a : u8` - the accumulator
- `x : u8` - index register x
- `y : u8` - index register y
- `s : u8` - stack pointer register
- `p : u8` - processor flag register
- `zero : bool` - the zero flag, used to indicate if the result of the last operation resulted in the value 0.
- `carry : bool` - the carry flag, used to indicate if the last operation resulted in a carry outside of the range 0 .. 255. For addition, the `carry` flag is `true` when an addition resulted in a carry, and `false` otherwise. For subtraction and comparison, the `carry` flag is `false` when there is a borrow (left-hand side was less than the right-hand side), and `true` otherwise. The `carry` also indicates the bit shifted out from a bit-shift operation.
- `negative : bool` - the negative flag, used to indicate the sign bit (bit 7) of the last operation.
- `overflow : bool` - the overflow flag, used to indicate if the last operation resulted an arithmetic overflow. If an overflow happened, the sign bit (bit 7) of the result is flipped.
- `decimal : bool` - the decimal flag, used to indicate whether decimal mode is active. If `true`, numbers are treated as if they are packed binary-coded decimal (BCD) format. If `false`, numbers are treated as binary numbers. Some 6502 CPUs like the 2A03/2A07 used in the NES do not have a decimal mode, so BCD arithmetic must be manually accomplished through software.
- `nointerrupt : bool` - the interrupt disable flag, used to indicate that maskable interrupt requests (IRQ) are disallowed. This will not disable non-maskable interrupts (NMI).

## Intrinsics

- `cmp(left, right)` - compares two values, by performing a subtraction without storing the result in memory. `zero` indicates whether `left == right`, `carry` indicates whether `left >= right`.
- `bit(mem)` - bitwise test between the accumulator and a value in memory. `zero` indicates whether `(a & mem) == 0`, `overflow` is set to `mem $ 6`, and `negative` is set to `mem $ 7`.
- `irqcall(code)` - manually requests an IRQ, code is a parameter that is put after irqcall opcode, which can be read from the IRQ handler routine.
- `push(value)` - pushes the given value to the stack.
- `pop(value)` - pushes the given value to the stack.
- `nop()` - does nothing, and uses 1 byte and 2 cycles.

## Tests and Branches

- `a`, `x` and `y` can be used with comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, or `>=`) inside conditional branches. A branch like `if a >= 5 { ... }` becomes `if { cmp(a, 5); } && carry { ... }`.
- `a & mem == 0` or `a & mem != 0` can be used as a conditional branches. `if a & mem == 0 { ... }` becomes `if { bit(mem); } && zero { ... }` and `if a & mem != 0 { ... }` becomes `if { bit(mem) } && !zero { ... }` 
- `mem $ 6` can be used as a conditional branch for testing bit 6 of memory. `if mem $ 6 { ... }` becomes `if { bit(mem); } && overflow { ... }` 
- `mem $ 7` can be used as a conditional branch for testing bit 7 of memory. `if mem $ 7 { ... }` becomes `if { bit(mem); } && negative { ... }` 

## Addressing Modes

- `{0..255}` - immediate
- `*({0..255} as *u8)` - zero-page
- `*(({0..255} + x) as *u8)` - zero-page indexed by x
- `*(({0..255} + y) as *u8)` - zero-page indexed by y
- `*(*(({0..255} + x) as *u16) as *u8)` - zero-page indexed by x indirect
- `*(({0..255} + y) as *u8)` - zero-page indexed by y
- `*((*({0..255} as *u16) + y) as *u8)` - zero-page indirect indexed by y
- `*({0..65535} as *u8)` - absolute indexed by x
- `*(({0..65535} + x) as *u8)` - absolute indexed by x
- `*(({0..65535} + y) as *u8)` - absolute indexed by y
