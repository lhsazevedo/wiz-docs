# MOS 65C02

The MOS 65C02 is like the MOS 6502, but also has some extra instructions.

## Extra Intrinsics

- `test_and_reset(mem)` - like `bit(mem)`, but also uses the accumulator to turn off bits in mem, as if `mem &= ~a;` is applied.
- `test_and_set(mem)` - like `bit(mem)`, but also uses the accumulator to turn on bits in mem, as if `mem |= a;` is applied.

## Extra Instructions

```wiz
a = *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a += *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a +#= *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a -= *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a -#= *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a |= *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a &= *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
a ^= *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8)
*(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8) = a
cmp(a, *(*({0..255} as *u16) as *u8))

bit({0..255})
bit(*(({0..255} + x) as *u8))
bit(*(({0..65535} + x) as *u8))

++a
--a

goto {-128..127}

goto *(({0..65535} + x) as *u16)

push(x)

x = pop()
