# HuC 6280

The HuC6280 is like the Rockwell 65C02, but has some extra registers and instructions. Also, zero page instructions are at 0x2000 .. 0x20FF rather than the usual 0x00 .. 0xFF of other 6502 processors. This can be bank-switched with the `mpr1` register.

## Extra Registers

- `turbo_speed : bool` - CPU turbo mode setting
- `vdc_select : u8` - VDC address select register (fast access)
- `vdc_data_l : u8` - VDC data register low (fast access)
- `vdc_data_h : u8` - VDC data register high (fast access) 
- The VDC registers are also available in a memory mapped I/O registers, these registers are just for special quick-write instructions in the CPU.
- `mpr0 : u8` - mapper register 0, maps the memory bank available at address range `0x0000 .. 0x1FFF`.
- `mpr1 : u8` - mapper register 1, maps the memory bank available at address range `0x2000 .. 0x3FFF`. Affects zero page.
- `mpr2 : u8` - mapper register 2, maps the memory bank available at address range `0x4000 .. 0x5FFF`.
- `mpr3 : u8` - mapper register 3, maps the memory bank available at address range `0x6000 .. 0x7FFF`.
- `mpr4 : u8` - mapper register 4, maps the memory bank available at address range `0x8000 .. 0x9FFF`.
- `mpr5 : u8` - mapper register 5, maps the memory bank available at address range `0xA000 .. 0xBFFF`.
- `mpr6 : u8` - mapper register 6, maps the memory bank available at address range `0xC000 .. 0xDFFF`.
- `mpr7 : u8` - mapper register 7, maps the memory bank available at address range `0xE000 .. 0xFFFF`.

## Extra Intrinsics

- `swap(left, right)` - exchanges the values between the left and right operand.
- `transfer_alternate_to_increment(source, dest, len)` - transfers `len` bytes of data from an alternating `source` address (`source`, `source + 1`, `source`, ...) to an incrementing `dest` address (`dest`, `dest + 1`, `dest + 2`, ...). 
- `transfer_increment_to_alternate(source, dest, len)` - transfers `len` bytes of data from an incrementing `source` address (`source`, `source + 1`, `source + 2`, ...)  to an alternating `dest` address (`dest`, `dest + 1`, `dest`, ...). 
- `transfer_decrement_to_decrement(source, dest, len)` - transfers `len` bytes of data from an decrementing `source` address address (`source`, `source - 1`, `source - 2`, ...) to an decrementing `dest` address (`dest`, `dest - 1`, `dest - 2`, ...). 
- `transfer_increment_to_increment(source, dest, len)` - transfers `len` bytes of data from an incrementing `source` address address (`source`, `source + 1`, `source + 2`, ...) to an incrementing `dest` address (`dest`, `dest + 1`, `dest + 2`, ...).
- `transfer_increment_to_fixed(source, dest, len)` - transfers `len` bytes of data from an incrementing `source` address address (`source`, `source + 1`, `source + 2`, ...) to a fixed `dest` address (`dest`, `dest`, `dest`, ...).
- `mpr_set(mask, a)` - sets `mpr0` .. `mpr7` registers to the value in the accumulator, using `mask` to indicate which of registers are being selected to update. For N = 0 .. 7, if `mask $ N` is `true` (`(mask & (1 << N)) != 0`), then `mprN` will be set to `a`.
- `tst(imm, mem)` - like `bit` but the `zero` flag is the result of whether `(imm & bit) == 0`.
