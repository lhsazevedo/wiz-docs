# WDC 65C02

The WDC 65C02 is like the Rockwell 65C02 but also has some extra instructions.

## Extra Intrinsics
- `stop_until_reset()` - stops execution until a hardware reset occurs.
- `wait_until_reset()` - sleeps until a hardware interrupt occurs.

## Extra Instructions

```wiz
stop_until_reset()
wait_until_interrupt()
```
